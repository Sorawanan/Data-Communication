# Data-Communication
I chooses JAVA language to write the code. So, make sure that your device is already setup JAVA environment.
[ 1 ] Parity Bit
  - This program does not require any input from the user. So, you can click the run button and the
      program will execute and log all the data in the console.
  - This program executes for 4 attempts and each attempt has 4 datawords inside the array and
      changes the method for 4 different methods. (One-dimensional even Parity bit, One-dimensional odd
      Parity bit, two-dimensional even Parity bit, two-dimensional odd Parity bit)
[ 2 ] Hamming code
  - This program require the input from the user. The user only needs to input the data word that
      they want to encode with hamming code. And the program will log all the information and check for correctness.
[ 3 ] CRC
  - This program needs data from the user, so users fill in dataword bits and bits of divisor, press run,
      program will execute and will show value Generated  for user to copy data. and input  
[ 4 ] Checksum
  - This program requires information from the user. So user enter dataword bits for sent and size blocks,
      press run, program will execute and it will show sum,complement and check value(PASS=1 or FAIL=0).
